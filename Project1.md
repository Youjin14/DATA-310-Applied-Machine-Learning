## 1. Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?
     
  The social distance detector was somewhat effective at detecting potential violations. The original video I used was a recording of the famous Shibuya street crossing in Tokyo, Japan. The video is from five years ago, but I wanted to see how many violations there would be if social distancing was applied then.
  There were too many crossing the street at once. This may be due to the fact that street is a three way crossing. Additionally, this street is known for being in a very populated area and is a popular crossing where thousands of people walk daily. 


## 2. Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time?  How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?

I believe this approach would be a good estimator of new infections. However, the detector cannot see if a pedistrian is wearing a mask or not, which could decrease the likelihood of the infection spreading.
Without having time to set up, I believe using footage from already installed cameras would be ran through the detector. 

## 3. What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?

I believe this approach could be used if the cameras are in higher definition, there are multiple cameras in different point areas, and if the code could be more sensitive to areas where there are many people congregated/moving.
