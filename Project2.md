## 1. Go to Neural style transfer and complete the tensorflow exercise at that location.
Read the linked paper about the method by Gatys et al. Modify the content_image
and style_image to produce your own stylize work of art. Minimize the number of
epoch runs in order to output your produced image faster for review and
consideration. Incorporate the total variation loss method in your script and
increase the number of epochs to improve the quality of your stylized artwork. Use
your stylized artwork to draft an entry for the Jump Start Data Science Summer
Program competition. Use your imagination when designing your proposed teeshirt. Feel free to design either a square shaped space for the front, front and back
or a whole of tee-shirt approach. Be sure to identify the Jump Start Data Science
Summer Program in your draft entry. Create a GitHub pages site, upload your
design, and provide a brief description of the inspiration you drew upon in order to
create your work of art!
