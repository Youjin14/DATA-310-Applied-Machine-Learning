## 1. Go to Neural style transfer and complete the tensorflow exercise at that location.
Read the linked paper about the method by Gatys et al. Modify the content_image
and style_image to produce your own stylize work of art. Minimize the number of
epoch runs in order to output your produced image faster for review and
consideration. Incorporate the total variation loss method in your script and
increase the number of epochs to improve the quality of your stylized artwork. Use
your stylized artwork to draft an entry for the Jump Start Data Science Summer
Program competition. Use your imagination when designing your proposed teeshirt. Feel free to design either a square shaped space for the front, front and back
or a whole of tee-shirt approach. Be sure to identify the Jump Start Data Science
Summer Program in your draft entry. Create a GitHub pages site, upload your
design, and provide a brief description of the inspiration you drew upon in order to
create your work of art!

For my submission, rather than focusing on sharing information about data science at William and Mary, I wanted to show what data science can accomplish! The picture showcases the amazing potential and possibilities of data science, especially when it is applied to art. Inspired by the current social and political climate, I wanted to combine two pictures that both have strong messages. What wouldn't have been considered and couldn't be possible before, I ended up merging a picture from the Black Lives Matter Protest and the famous French painting La liberté Guidant le Peuple (Liberty leading the People). 

These two pictures are drastically different from each other as they were created during different time periods, in different countries, and by different artists. However, the same message prevails, the people will rise against injustice and fight for equal freedom. 

I did not expect to get the results shown in the picture. I hoped by applying the La liberté Guidant le Peuple's grainy vibe and strong red, white, and blue colors onto a black and white photo, it would emphasize the colors of freedom. However, I believe the results are a new work of art too! I hope the amalgamated picture shares the message that the two separate images represent. 

This project has made me appreciate just how complex neural networks can be, but also the beautiful art that can result from these networks.
