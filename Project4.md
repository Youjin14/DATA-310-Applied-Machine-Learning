Project 4A.Generate text from a source using a Recurrent Neural Network model and perform it1.Decide with your team members on a text from a screen play or a musical artist that you all find interesting.  Identify the script from the play or lyrics from the artists songs and copy them into a text file for import into your python workspace.2.Replace the Shakespeare text with your own selected text.  Fit a model to your source text and run the generate_text() command at the end of the exercise to produce synthetic output from your RNN model.  Return to the source text and modify it as needed in order to generate comprehensible output.  You are welcome to synthesize different sources or copy lyrics from multiple songs.  Try to follow the format of the Shakespeare text (i.e. name followed by speech).  Longer texts will most likely work better.3.For Monday have your fit model prepared and also be ready to execute the generate_text() command during class.  Upon generation of your text output, perform it as a group.  Give your impromptu piece a title and share it with the group before you perform
