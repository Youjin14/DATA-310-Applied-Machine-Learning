## 1. What is TF Hub?  How did you use it when creating your script for “text classification of movie reviews”?

On the official TensorFlow website, TF Hub is defined as "a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models." (https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) In the script for text classification of movie reviews, TF Hub was used for transfer learning. For the example, TensorFlow Hub was used to call a pre-trained text embedding model to test the data. 


## 2. What are the optimizer and loss functions?  How good was your “text classification of movie reviews” model?

The loss function measures how accurate the model is during training. An optimizer function is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function. The text classification of movie reviews model returned a loss of 0.313, and an accuracy of 0.866. 

## 3. In “text classification with preprocessed text” you produced a graph of training and validation loss.  Add the graph to this response and provide a brief explanation. 
   ## 4. Likewise do the same for the training and validation accuracy graph
