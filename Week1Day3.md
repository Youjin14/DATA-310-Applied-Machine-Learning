Question 1: 
In the video, First steps in computer vision, Laurence Maroney introduces us to the
Fashion MNIST data set and using it to train a neural network in order to teach a
computer “how to see.” One of the first steps towards this goal is splitting the data into
two groups, a set of training images and training labels and then also a set of test
images and test labels. Why is this done? What is the purpose of splitting the data into
a training set and a test set?

The purpose of splitting the data into training and testing groups is to form a model that is most accurate. The process takes
a portion of the overall data to train the neural network. Then we test the neural network on remaining data that it has never
processed/seen before.
