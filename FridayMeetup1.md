During this Alumni meet-up, I was able to hear from William and Mary alumni, Tommy Jones. Tommy currently works at in-Q-Tel and Vice President for Data Community DC, Inc. He first started studying International Relations then Economics. From there, Tommy earned his Masters in Math and is almost finished with his PhD program for computer science. His diverse background has helped him apply his coding and computer science knowledge to a variety of professions and work fields. Some advice he shared was that certifications are not all that important. Only that you have a strong foundation to base the coding you have to complete for a job is more important. Additionally, (like most speakers) he shared the uncertainty behind the data science field. As it continues to grow, no one truly knows how or what can be applied.
