Today, we met with Ben Arancibia, a data scientist at GSK, and Jasper Lu, the Head of Data Science at TripAdvisor. Both started in different fields, but integrated data science into their undergraduate majors (International Relations (Ben) & Economics (Jasper)).

Ben works in the pharmaceutical field and collects and analyzes scientific data. Jasper works for a travel company and looks at the supply and demand of trends in the travel field. 

From the meeting, Ben and Jasper shared their opinions and outlook on data science as a field and profession. They explained how data science is a growing field and is growing in importance everyday. Big data is highly desired by many companies, and provides much insight in areas such as business, science, government, and more! They also explained their experience with data science and how certain certificates or verifications are not very necessary. Pursuing graduate school is great for additional research. However, many companies look for work experience if not research experience. Additionally, a big point both speakers emphasized on was how working in data science requires communication skills. They explained how you can do great and amazing things with data and learn new information that can help a company greatly. However, if you cannot explain the results clearly and others cannot understand your findings, ultimately, you may be fired. Entering a company, it is best to not only understand the data science aspect but also the organization itself and how data science is integrated into the business itself.
